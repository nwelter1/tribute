        <ul class="lead">
          <li>She was one of the first African Americans to receive a degree in anthropology.</li>
        <li>She was a part of a ground breaking group of cultural anthropologist who challenged the ideas of colonialism  with evidence-driven analysis.</li>
        <li>Her ethnographic studies directly fed into her classic novel, <em>Their Eyes Were Watching God.</em></li>
        <li>She was not seen as a major writer for her time. The largest royalty she ever earned was $943.75. She never made enough money off her work to support herself.</li>
        <li>The world did not realize her genius until after her death. The revival of her work was sparked by Alice Walker in 1975 after she penned her famous essay called, "Looking for Zora."</li>

      <div class="col-6">
      <ul class="lead">
        <li>Her father was the mayor of one of America's first all-black communities located in Eatonville, Florida.  It was a community that forever shaped her perspective of the world.</li>
        <li>In order to qualify for free public schooling, 26-year old Zora successfully presented herself as teenager, attained her high school diploma and continued on to study at Barnard College.</li>
        <li>She had a falling out with Langston Hughes while they wrote "Mule Bone" together. A messy dispute led to a creative standstill which ended their close relationship. They never repaired the friendship during their lifetimes.</li>
        <li>Already famous in Harlem's circles for her short stories, she struggled to balance her creative and scientific personas.</li>
        <li>She once took to a Harlem street corner with a pair of calipers to measure people's skulls all in the name of research.</li>
